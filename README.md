An Interactive Map and an Editor for your Roleplaying Adventure


This is a project to create an Application to create and view an interactive map mainly focused on usage in Roleplaying such as DnD.

Planned are an editor at which you can create a map of a particular size. You will be able to mark areas as specific types (such as grassland, mountain, city and so forth).

Furthermore you can create points of interests (POI) and add more information to them to establish your created world and lore.


In the end you should be able to view a generated map in 3D, pan the camera around and click on POIs to view their information.

Also you should be able to create a path to follow and to plan your adventures using waypoints and arrows.


When this is all finished, the application could be improved by adding an event system. The DM can create events that happen and alter the map and it's information accordingly.
